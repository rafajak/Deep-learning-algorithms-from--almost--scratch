# Deep learning from (almost) scratch


Inspired by a great article by Emil Wallner on Floydhub's blog, I decided to use Python to reimplement several algorithms that made Deep Learning what it is today. All from (almost*) scratch.

1. Least squares
2. Gradient descent [a simplistic example of]
3. Linear regression
4. Perceptron
5. Simple neural network in NumPy and PyTorch

*- To paraphrase Carl Sagan - If you wish to make an artificial neural network from scratch, you must first invent the universe (and NumPy).

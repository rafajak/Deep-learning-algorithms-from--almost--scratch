# Deep learning from (almost) scratch


Inspired by a great article by Emil Wallner on Floydhub's blog, I decided to use Python to implement several algorithms that made Deep Learning what it is today. All from (almost*) scratch.

1. Least squares
2. Gradient descent
3. Perceptron
4. [todo] Neural network
5. [todo] Deep Neural Network 

*- To paraphrase Carl Sagan - If you wish to make a artificial neural network from scratch, you must first invent the universe.
